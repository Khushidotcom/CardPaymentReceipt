Masked Number Display Script
This Python script takes an input string (typically a 16-digit number, such as a credit card number), masks the first 12 digits with x characters, and prints only the last 4 digits visible for privacy.

🔍 How It Works
The user inputs a number (like a credit card number).

The script extracts the last 4 digits.

The first 12 digits are replaced by a masked pattern: "xxxxxxxxxxxx".

The result is printed in a masked format like: xxxxxxxxxxxx1234.
